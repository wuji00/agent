# Notes

## Task
Implement four demos from `anthropics/claude-quickstarts` using LangChain and LangGraph.

## Demos to implement
1. Customer Support Agent
2. Financial Data Analyst
3. Computer Use Demo
4. Browser Tools API Demo (Browser Use)

## Plan
I will implement each demo in its own subdirectory within `langchain_claude_demos`.
I will use the `langchain-anthropic` package for the models.
I will use `langgraph` for the agentic flows.
