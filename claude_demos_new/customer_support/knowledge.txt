Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that's working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.
We want AI to be helpful, honest, and harmless.
Our first product is Claude, an AI assistant.
Claude is capable of a wide variety of tasks, including coding, writing, analysis, and more.
Claude is available via API and a chat interface at claude.ai.
Claude 3 is our latest model family, featuring Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus.
Claude 3.5 Sonnet is our most intelligent and capable model to date.
You can use Claude for customer support, content creation, coding assistance, and much more.
Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former OpenAI researchers.
We believe that AI has the potential to be a powerful tool for good.
Safety is at the core of everything we do.
Constitutional AI is a technique we developed to train AI systems to be helpful and harmless.
We are based in San Francisco, California.

Stay tuned for updates on our blog.
The computer use capability allows Claude to interact with computers like a human.
This feature is currently in beta.
Financial analysis is another strong use case for Claude.
Claude can help analyze market trends and generate reports.
 Autonomous coding agents can help automate development workflows.
We offer SDKs for Python and TypeScript.
LangChain and LangGraph are popular frameworks for building applications with Claude.
Our quickstarts repository provides examples of how to use Claude in various scenarios.
Customer support agents can be built using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).
Vector databases like FAISS or Chroma can be used to store knowledge.
Embeddings are used to represent text numerically for semantic search.
LangGraph allows for building stateful, multi-step agents.
Human-in-the-loop workflows are supported by LangGraph.
Checkpoints allow you to save and resume agent state.
Subgraphs enable modular agent design.
We recommend using the latest version of our SDKs.
API keys should be kept secret and not shared.
Rate limits apply to API usage.
You can monitor your usage in the console.
We value user feedback and use it to improve our products.
