- Cloned anthropics/claude-quickstarts as reference.
- Identified 4 demos: Customer Support Agent, Financial Data Analyst, Computer Use Demo, Browser Use Demo.
- Created separate folders for each demo implementation.
- Implemented Customer Support Agent using LangChain RAG (FAISS + HuggingFaceEmbeddings) and LangGraph.
- Implemented Financial Data Analyst using LangGraph and structured output tool .
- Implemented Computer Use Demo using LangGraph and mock tools.
- Implemented Browser Use Demo using LangGraph and mock tools.
- Created  with necessary dependencies.
- Using  for simpler tasks and  for complex tool use.
- Ensured code is robust to missing optional dependencies (like huggingface) with fallbacks where possible (though RAG requires it).
