# Investigation Report

## Overview
The previous commit added only an `AGENTS.md` file, but the user did not see the expected artifacts in the repository. This investigation created the required workspace structure to ensure the repository contains the prescribed notes and report files.

## Actions Taken
- Reviewed `AGENTS.md` to confirm investigation workflow requirements.
- Created an `investigation-workflow` folder to store investigation outputs.
- Documented the process in `notes.md` as activities were performed.
- Authored this README to summarize the investigation and resulting changes.

## Next Steps
No further action is required unless additional investigation tasks are requested.
