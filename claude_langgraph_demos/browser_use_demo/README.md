# Browser Use Demo (Mock)

This directory contains a LangGraph implementation of the Browser Use Demo.

**Note:** This is a mock implementation. The tools log actions but do not execute them on a real browser (requires Playwright/Selenium setup which is mocked here).

## Running the Agent

You can run the agent interactively:

```bash
python agent.py
```

## Description

The agent uses a mock `browser_tool` to simulate web navigation and interaction.
